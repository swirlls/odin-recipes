            <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>This is a great recipe that I found in my 
                    Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the 
                    weathered look of this recipe card, this was 
                    a family favorite.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
                    <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
                    <li>1 egg</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, 
                        baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in 
                        the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted 
                        butter; mix until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over 
                        medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto 
                        the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each 
                        pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
                </ol>
