            <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>A pancake is a flat cake, often thin and round, 
                    prepared from a starch-based batter that may 
                    contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a 
                    hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, 
                    often frying with oil or butter. It is a 
                    type of batter bread.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 russet potatoes, peeled</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons clarified butter</li>
                    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                    <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
                    <li>1 pinch paprika, or to taste</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Shred potatoes into a large bowl filled 
                        with cold water. Stir until water is 
                        cloudy, drain, and cover potatoes again 
                        with fresh cold water. Stir again to 
                        dissolve excess starch. Drain potatoes 
                        well, pat dry with paper towels, and 
                        squeeze out any excess moisture.</li>
                    <li>Heat clarified butter in a large non-stick 
                        pan over medium heat. Sprinkle shredded 
                        potatoes into the hot butter and season with 
                        salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and 
                        paprika.</li>
                    <li>Cook potatoes until a brown crust forms on 
                        the bottom, about 5 minutes. Continue to 
                        cook and stir until potatoes are browned 
                        all over, about 5 more minutes.</li>
                </ol>
